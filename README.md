# odin-recipes

We would like to have create a page for recipes. Within that page there's different names
for the recipes and when clicked on, it takes us to that recipe. When clicked on, a new page will open and we will have the list of ingredients, a picture of how the food looks and how to make the dish. Make it clear, concise and understandable for any user to be able to read it.
